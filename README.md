## Hello Constraint Homework - Solution Code

The Hello Toast app is a simple app that consists of three button elements and one TextView. An activity_main.xml, activity_main.xml (land), and activity_main.xml (xlarge). When the user taps the first button, it displays a short message (a Toast) on the screen. 

 
## Pre-requisites

For this app you should be familiar with creating and running apps in Android Studio.

## Getting Started

Download and open the app in Android Studio.

## The Homework app should contain the following features:

<li>It should display the Zero button.

<li>The Zero button is between the Toast and Count buttons.

<li>Tapping the second button increases a "click" counter displayed in the TextView, which starts at zero.

<li>The app includes an implementation of the click handler method for the Zero button to reset the count to 0.

<li>The method must show the zero count in the show_count TextView.

<li>The click handler must also reset the Zero button's own background color to gray.

<li>The click handler method for the Count button has been updated to change its own background color depending on whether the new count is odd or even.

<li>This method must use the view parameter to access the button.
This method must also change the background of the Zero button to a color other than gray.
